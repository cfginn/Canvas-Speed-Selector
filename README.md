# Canvas-Speed-Selector

Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (or any other prefered script manager) to your browser

After installing, add a new script and copy in the contents of [script.user.js] (script.user.js). Save this script and ensure its enabled

Once the script has been saved, you should see a dropdown and a button in the upper right corner of the canvas module screen. Simply select the desired speed and hit the button.

Note: You will have to set the speed each time a new video starts.
